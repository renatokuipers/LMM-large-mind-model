# Motivation module 

# TODO: Implement the motivation module factory function to return an integrated MotivationSystem
# This module should be responsible for drives, goals, needs, interests,
# and the regulation of behavior toward desired outcomes.

# TODO: Create MotivationSystem class that integrates all motivation sub-components:
# - basic_drives: fundamental physiological and safety motivators
# - goal_setting: establishing and pursuing objectives
# - need_satisfaction: meeting psychological needs
# - interest_development: cultivating curiosity and engagement
# - value_based_motivation: alignment with personal values

# TODO: Implement development tracking for motivation
# Motivational systems should develop from simple drive satisfaction in early stages
# to complex, integrated goal hierarchies and value-based motivation in later stages

# TODO: Connect motivation module to emotion, learning, and executive modules
# Motivation should be influenced by emotional states, direct
# learning activities, and guide executive functions

# TODO: Implement motivational regulation processes
# Include processes for goal adjustment, effort allocation, 
# persistence management, and motivational conflict resolution
