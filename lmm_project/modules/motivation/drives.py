# TODO: Implement the Drives class to handle basic motivational drives
# This component should be able to:
# - Maintain and regulate fundamental drives (curiosity, social connection, etc.)
# - Generate activation signals based on drive strength
# - Adapt drive intensity based on satisfaction and deprivation
# - Develop more sophisticated drives as the system matures

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in drives:
# - Simple approach/avoid drives in early stages
# - Growing repertoire of drives in childhood
# - Integration of drives with higher cognition in adolescence
# - Self-regulation of drives in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Drive activation: Increase drive strength based on deprivation
# - Drive satisfaction: Reduce drive strength when needs are met
# - Drive prioritization: Determine which drives are most pressing
# - Homeostatic regulation: Maintain balance across different needs

# TODO: Implement different drive types:
# - Exploration drive: Curiosity and information-seeking
# - Social drive: Connection and interaction needs
# - Competence drive: Desire to develop skills and abilities
# - Autonomy drive: Self-direction and choice

# TODO: Connect to emotion and executive function modules
# Drives should influence emotional states and be regulated
# by executive control mechanisms
