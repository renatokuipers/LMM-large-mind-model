# TODO: Implement the Needs class to handle psychological needs
# This component should be able to:
# - Represent and track fundamental psychological needs
# - Signal need states to other modules
# - Detect need satisfaction and frustration
# - Influence goal formation and emotional states

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in needs:
# - Basic attachment needs in early stages
# - Growing autonomy needs in childhood
# - Identity-related needs in adolescence
# - Self-actualization needs in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Need activation: Signal when needs require attention
# - Need satisfaction detection: Recognize when needs are met
# - Need frustration detection: Identify when needs are thwarted
# - Need integration: Balance competing needs

# TODO: Implement different need types:
# - Autonomy: Need for self-direction and choice
# - Competence: Need to feel effective and capable
# - Relatedness: Need for social connection
# - Meaning/Purpose: Need for significance and contribution

# TODO: Connect to emotion and identity modules
# Needs should influence emotional responses and
# contribute to identity formation
