# TODO: Implement the GoalSetting class to establish and pursue objectives
# This component should be able to:
# - Create goals based on drives, needs, and values
# - Maintain goal hierarchies with sub-goals
# - Track progress toward goal achievement
# - Adjust goals based on feasibility and changing priorities

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in goal setting:
# - Simple immediate goals in early stages
# - Short-term goal sequences in childhood
# - Longer-term goal planning in adolescence
# - Complex hierarchical goals with abstract endpoints in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Goal generation: Create goals from various motivational inputs
# - Goal evaluation: Assess importance and feasibility of potential goals
# - Progress monitoring: Track advancement toward goals
# - Goal adjustment: Modify goals when necessary

# TODO: Implement different goal types:
# - Approach goals: Aimed at achieving positive outcomes
# - Avoidance goals: Aimed at preventing negative outcomes
# - Learning goals: Focused on skill acquisition
# - Performance goals: Focused on demonstrating competence

# TODO: Connect to executive function and belief modules
# Goal setting should guide executive planning processes
# and be informed by beliefs about self-efficacy
