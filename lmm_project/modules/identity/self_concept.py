# TODO: Implement the SelfConcept class to maintain beliefs about the self
# This component should be able to:
# - Represent knowledge and beliefs about the self
# - Organize self-knowledge into domains (abilities, traits, etc.)
# - Update self-concept based on experiences and feedback
# - Maintain consistency in self-representation

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in self-concept:
# - Simple categorical self-recognition in early stages
# - Concrete trait descriptions in childhood
# - Social comparison and ideal self in adolescence
# - Complex, nuanced self-understanding in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Self-schema formation: Organize self-knowledge by domain
# - Self-evaluation: Assess self-attributes against standards
# - Identity integration: Maintain coherence across domains
# - Self-verification: Seek confirmation of existing self-views

# TODO: Implement different self-concept domains:
# - Ability domain: Beliefs about capabilities and skills
# - Social domain: Representations of social roles and identities
# - Physical domain: Beliefs about physical attributes
# - Psychological domain: Understanding of internal states and traits

# TODO: Connect to memory and social systems
# Self-concept should draw on autobiographical memory
# and incorporate social feedback and comparisons
