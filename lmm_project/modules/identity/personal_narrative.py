# TODO: Implement the PersonalNarrative class to create autobiographical continuity
# This component should be able to:
# - Construct a coherent story of personal experiences
# - Integrate new experiences into the ongoing narrative
# - Identify themes and patterns across experiences
# - Maintain temporal continuity of identity

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in personal narrative:
# - Simple episodic sequences in early stages
# - Chronological life stories in childhood
# - Theme-based integration in adolescence
# - Complex, meaning-focused narratives in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Narrative construction: Form coherent stories from experiences
# - Causal connection: Link events with causal relationships
# - Thematic integration: Identify recurring themes and patterns
# - Meaning-making: Extract personal significance from events

# TODO: Implement narrative characteristics:
# - Coherence: Logical and temporal consistency
# - Complexity: Multilayered interpretation of events
# - Agency: Sense of control in one's life story
# - Emotional tone: Overall valence of the narrative

# TODO: Connect to episodic memory and belief systems
# Personal narrative should draw on episodic memories
# and influence/be influenced by the belief system
