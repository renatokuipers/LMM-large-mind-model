# Identity module 

# TODO: Implement the identity module factory function to return an integrated IdentitySystem
# This module should be responsible for self-concept, personal narrative,
# preferences, and personality trait development.

# TODO: Create IdentitySystem class that integrates all identity sub-components:
# - self_concept: representation of self-knowledge and beliefs about self
# - personal_narrative: autobiographical story that creates continuity of self
# - preferences: likes, dislikes, and value judgments
# - personality_traits: stable patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving

# TODO: Implement development tracking for identity
# Identity should develop from minimal self-awareness in early stages
# to complex, integrated self-concept in adulthood

# TODO: Connect identity module to memory, emotion, and social modules
# Identity should be informed by autobiographical memories, emotional
# responses, and social feedback

# TODO: Implement stability vs. change dynamics
# The system should maintain some stability in identity while
# allowing for appropriate change and growth over time
