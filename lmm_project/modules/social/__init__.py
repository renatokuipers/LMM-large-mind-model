# TODO: Implement the social module factory function to return an integrated SocialSystem
# This module should be responsible for social cognition, relationship modeling,
# moral reasoning, and understanding social norms.

# TODO: Create SocialSystem class that integrates all social sub-components:
# - theory_of_mind: understanding others' mental states
# - social_norms: learning and applying social rules
# - moral_reasoning: making ethical judgments
# - relationship_models: representing social relationships

# TODO: Implement development tracking for social cognition
# Social capabilities should develop from basic social responsiveness in early stages
# to sophisticated social understanding and nuanced moral reasoning in later stages

# TODO: Connect social module to emotion, language, and memory modules
# Social cognition should be informed by emotional understanding,
# utilize language representations, and draw on social memories

# TODO: Implement perspective-taking capabilities
# Include the ability to represent others' viewpoints, understand
# how situations appear to others, and imagine others' experiences
