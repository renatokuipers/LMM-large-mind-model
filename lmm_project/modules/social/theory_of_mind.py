# TODO: Implement the TheoryOfMind class to understand others' mental states
# This component should be able to:
# - Represent others' beliefs, desires, and intentions
# - Infer mental states from observed behavior
# - Understand false beliefs and different perspectives
# - Track multiple agents' mental models simultaneously

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in theory of mind:
# - Simple agency detection in early stages
# - Understanding desires before beliefs in early childhood
# - First-order belief representation in childhood
# - Higher-order mental state representation in adolescence/adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Perspective taking: Simulate others' viewpoints
# - Belief inference: Deduce what others believe
# - Intention recognition: Infer goals from actions
# - Mental state tracking: Monitor changes in others' knowledge

# TODO: Implement different levels of mental state representation:
# - First-order: What others believe
# - Second-order: What others believe about others' beliefs
# - Higher-order: More complex nested mental states
# - Shared mental models: Common ground in interaction

# TODO: Connect to language and memory modules
# Theory of mind should utilize language processing
# and draw on memories of past social interactions
