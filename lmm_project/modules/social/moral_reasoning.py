# TODO: Implement the MoralReasoning class to make ethical judgments
# This component should be able to:
# - Evaluate actions based on ethical principles
# - Reason about moral dilemmas
# - Apply different ethical frameworks to situations
# - Develop and refine moral intuitions

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in moral reasoning:
# - Simple reward/punishment orientation in early stages
# - Rule-based morality in childhood
# - Social contract perspective in adolescence
# - Principled moral reasoning in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Harm detection: Identify potential harmful consequences
# - Value application: Apply ethical values to situations
# - Moral conflict resolution: Balance competing ethical concerns
# - Ethical judgment: Form moral evaluations of actions

# TODO: Implement different moral reasoning approaches:
# - Consequentialist reasoning: Based on outcomes
# - Deontological reasoning: Based on rules and duties
# - Virtue ethics: Based on character and virtues
# - Care ethics: Based on relationships and care

# TODO: Connect to emotion and social norm modules
# Moral reasoning should be informed by emotional responses
# and interact with social norm understanding
