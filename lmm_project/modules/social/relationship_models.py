# TODO: Implement the RelationshipModels class to represent social relationships
# This component should be able to:
# - Model different types of relationships
# - Track relationship history and qualities
# - Update relationships based on interactions
# - Adapt behavior according to relationship context

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in relationship modeling:
# - Simple attachment relationships in early stages
# - Concrete friendship models in childhood
# - Complex peer and group relationships in adolescence
# - Sophisticated relationship dynamics in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Relationship formation: Establish new social connections
# - Quality assessment: Evaluate relationship attributes
# - History tracking: Maintain interaction records
# - Expectation modeling: Predict behavior based on relationship type

# TODO: Implement different relationship types:
# - Attachment relationships: Based on security and care
# - Friendships: Based on reciprocity and shared interests
# - Authority relationships: Based on hierarchy and respect
# - Group affiliations: Based on shared identity and belonging

# TODO: Connect to theory of mind and memory modules
# Relationship models should draw on theory of mind to understand
# others' expectations and store relationship information in memory
