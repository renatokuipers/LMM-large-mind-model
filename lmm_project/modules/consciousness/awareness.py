# TODO: Implement the Awareness class to monitor internal and external states
# This component should maintain awareness of:
# - External perceptual inputs
# - Internal emotional states
# - Current goals and motivations
# - Ongoing cognitive processes
# - Current attentional focus

# TODO: Implement developmental progression of awareness:
# - Basic stimulus awareness in early stages
# - Growing peripheral awareness in childhood
# - Self-directed awareness in adolescence
# - Integrated awareness of multiple states in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - State monitoring: Track current states across cognitive systems
# - Change detection: Identify significant changes in monitored states
# - Awareness broadcasting: Make aware states available to other systems
# - Attentional modulation: Prioritize awareness based on attention

# TODO: Implement levels of awareness:
# - Subliminal: Below threshold of awareness
# - Peripheral: At the edges of awareness
# - Focal: At the center of awareness
# - Meta-awareness: Awareness of being aware

# TODO: Connect to attention and global workspace systems
# Awareness should be influenced by attention and should feed
# information into the global workspace for conscious processing
