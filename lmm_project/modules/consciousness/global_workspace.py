# TODO: Implement the GlobalWorkspace class based on Global Workspace Theory
# This component should serve as an integration point where:
# - Specialized cognitive modules compete for access
# - Information becomes broadly available to multiple systems
# - Serial conscious processing emerges from parallel unconscious processing
# - Broadcasting of information creates a unified conscious experience

# TODO: Implement development progression in the global workspace:
# - Simple integration of basic inputs in early stages
# - Expanded capacity and sophistication in later stages
# - Increasing selectivity in information broadcasting
# - Metacognitive access to workspace contents in advanced stages

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Competition for access: Determine which information enters consciousness
# - Information broadcasting: Share conscious information with multiple modules
# - Maintenance of conscious content: Keep information active over time
# - Attentional modulation: Prioritize information based on attention signals

# TODO: Implement variable conscious access levels:
# - Primary consciousness: Awareness of perceptions and emotions
# - Higher-order consciousness: Awareness of being aware (metacognition)

# TODO: Create workspace capacity limitations that are:
# - Developmentally appropriate (expanding with age)
# - Reflective of human cognitive limitations
# - Subject to attentional control
