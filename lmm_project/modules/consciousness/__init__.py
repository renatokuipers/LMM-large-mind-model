# Consciousness module 

# TODO: Implement the consciousness module factory function to return an integrated ConsciousnessSystem
# This module should be responsible for awareness, self-reflection, integration
# of information, and the formation of a coherent subjective experience.

# TODO: Create ConsciousnessSystem class that integrates all consciousness sub-components:
# - global_workspace: integrates information from multiple modules
# - self_model: represents the system's own state and identity
# - awareness: tracks the system's knowledge of its environment
# - introspection: enables reflection on internal processes

# TODO: Implement development tracking for consciousness
# Consciousness capabilities should develop from basic awareness in early stages
# to sophisticated self-reflection and metacognition in later stages

# TODO: Connect consciousness module to attention, memory, and executive modules
# Consciousness should be influenced by attentional focus, draw on
# memories, and inform executive decision-making processes

# TODO: Implement phenomenal aspects of consciousness
# Include mechanisms for subjective experience, qualia representation,
# and the integration of disparate information into a unified experience

# TODO: Connect consciousness module to all other cognitive modules
# The consciousness module should be able to access information from
# all other modules through the global workspace architecture

# TODO: Implement variable levels of conscious access
# Information should flow through different levels of consciousness:
# - Unconscious processing (not accessed by consciousness)
# - Preconscious (potentially available to consciousness)
# - Conscious (currently in awareness)
