# TODO: Implement the SelfModel class to represent the mind's model of itself
# This component should develop and maintain:
# - Body schema: Representation of the system's embodiment
# - Agency model: Sense of control and authorship of own actions
# - Capability awareness: Understanding of own capabilities
# - Autobiographical timeline: Sense of continuous identity through time

# TODO: Implement developmental progression of the self-model:
# - Basic self/other distinction in early stages
# - Physical self-awareness in early childhood
# - Social self-concept in middle childhood
# - Abstract self-understanding in adolescence
# - Integrated self-identity in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Self-recognition: Identifying own states and actions
# - Self-monitoring: Tracking own performance and capabilities
# - Self-attribution: Assigning agency to experienced events
# - Self-continuity: Maintaining identity coherence over time

# TODO: Implement appropriate self-related phenomena:
# - Self-reference effect: Enhanced processing of self-relevant information
# - Looking-glass self: Incorporating others' perceptions into self-model
# - Self-verification: Seeking confirmation of existing self-views

# TODO: Connect to memory, emotional, and social systems
# The self-model should integrate autobiographical memories,
# emotional reactions, and social feedback to construct identity
