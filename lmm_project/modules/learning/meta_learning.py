# TODO: Implement the MetaLearning class to learn how to learn effectively
# This component should be able to:
# - Optimize learning strategies based on experience
# - Adapt learning approaches to different domains
# - Monitor learning progress and effectiveness
# - Transfer learning skills across contexts

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in meta-learning:
# - Simple learning strategy selection in early stages
# - Growing awareness of effective techniques in childhood
# - Strategic learning approach in adolescence
# - Sophisticated learning optimization in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Strategy evaluation: Assess effectiveness of learning approaches
# - Strategy selection: Choose appropriate learning methods
# - Learning monitoring: Track progress and understanding
# - Transfer optimization: Apply successful strategies to new domains

# TODO: Implement different meta-learning capabilities:
# - Learning rate adaptation: Adjust speed of learning
# - Attention allocation: Focus on most informative aspects
# - Study technique selection: Choose effective practice methods
# - Error analysis: Learn from mistakes and failures

# TODO: Connect to consciousness and executive function modules
# Meta-learning should utilize conscious reflection and
# executive control to direct learning processes
