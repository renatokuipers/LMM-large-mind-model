# TODO: Implement the ReinforcementLearning class to learn from rewards and punishments
# This component should be able to:
# - Learn value of actions based on their outcomes
# - Adjust behavior to maximize rewards
# - Balance exploration and exploitation
# - Adapt to changing reward structures

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in reinforcement learning:
# - Basic approach/avoid learning in early stages
# - Simple value learning in childhood
# - Strategic exploration in adolescence
# - Sophisticated reward maximization in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Value estimation: Determine the worth of states and actions
# - Policy learning: Develop rules for selecting actions
# - Temporal difference learning: Update estimates based on prediction errors
# - Exploration strategy: Balance known rewards with information gathering

# TODO: Implement different reinforcement learning approaches:
# - Model-free learning: Direct stimulus-response associations
# - Model-based learning: Build internal models of environment dynamics
# - Hierarchical reinforcement learning: Organize behaviors into abstraction levels
# - Multi-objective reinforcement learning: Balance multiple reward types

# TODO: Connect to motivation and executive function modules
# Reinforcement learning should be influenced by motivational drives
# and inform executive decision-making processes
