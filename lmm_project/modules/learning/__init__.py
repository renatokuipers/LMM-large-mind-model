# Learning module 

# TODO: Implement the learning module factory function to return an integrated LearningSystem
# This module should be responsible for different learning mechanisms,
# knowledge acquisition, and skill development.

# TODO: Create LearningSystem class that integrates all learning sub-components:
# - associative_learning: learns relationships between stimuli and events
# - reinforcement_learning: learns from rewards and punishments
# - observational_learning: learns by watching others
# - discovery_learning: learns through exploration and experimentation
# - structured_learning: learns from explicit instruction

# TODO: Implement development tracking for learning
# Learning capabilities should develop from simple associative learning in early stages
# to complex integrated learning approaches in later stages

# TODO: Connect learning module to memory, motivation, and attention modules
# Learning should store results in memory, be driven by motivation,
# and depend on attentional resources

# TODO: Implement metacognitive aspects of learning
# Develop reflection on learning processes, learning strategies,
# and self-regulation of learning approaches
