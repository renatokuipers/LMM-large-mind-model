# TODO: Implement the AssociativeLearning class to learn relationships between stimuli and events
# This component should be able to:
# - Detect temporal and spatial correlations between stimuli
# - Form associative links between co-occurring elements
# - Strengthen or weaken associations based on experience
# - Apply learned associations to predict outcomes

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in associative learning:
# - Simple paired associations in early stages
# - Multiple associative chains in childhood
# - Complex associative networks in adolescence
# - Sophisticated statistical association in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Correlation detection: Identify co-occurring stimuli or events
# - Link formation: Create connections between associated elements
# - Association strengthening: Reinforce connections through experience
# - Prediction generation: Use associations to anticipate outcomes

# TODO: Implement different associative learning types:
# - Classical conditioning: Stimulus-stimulus association
# - Operant conditioning: Response-outcome association
# - Observational learning: Vicariously formed associations
# - Statistical learning: Probabilistic pattern detection

# TODO: Connect to memory and perception modules
# Associative learning should store results in memory
# and process perceptual inputs for pattern detection
