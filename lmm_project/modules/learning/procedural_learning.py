# TODO: Implement the ProceduralLearning class to acquire skills and action sequences
# This component should be able to:
# - Learn sequences of actions through practice
# - Automate skill execution with repetition
# - Refine performance based on feedback
# - Transfer skills to similar contexts

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in procedural learning:
# - Simple action sequences in early stages
# - Growing skill repertoire in childhood
# - Skill refinement and expertise in adolescence
# - Automatic and fluent execution in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Sequence encoding: Represent ordered action sequences
# - Skill automation: Reduce cognitive load with practice
# - Performance feedback: Improve based on results
# - Skill generalization: Apply learned patterns to new contexts

# TODO: Implement different procedural learning types:
# - Motor skills: Physical action sequences
# - Cognitive procedures: Mental operation sequences
# - Perceptual-motor skills: Coordinated perception and action
# - Problem-solving procedures: Systematic solution approaches

# TODO: Connect to memory and motor control modules
# Procedural learning should store skills in procedural memory
# and coordinate with motor control for execution
