# TODO: Implement the BeliefFormation class to handle the creation of new beliefs
# This component should form beliefs based on:
# - Direct perceptual experiences
# - Information from memory
# - Learning through language and communication
# - Logical inference from existing beliefs

# TODO: Implement different belief formation strategies that evolve with development:
# - Simple associations in early stages
# - Basic causal reasoning in childhood stages
# - More complex logical reasoning in later stages

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Belief encoding: Convert experiences into belief representations
# - Belief structuring: Organize beliefs into coherent frameworks
# - Belief prioritization: Determine which beliefs are central vs. peripheral

# TODO: Implement validation checks for new beliefs
# - Consistency with existing beliefs
# - Evaluation of evidence quality
# - Detection of logical contradictions

# TODO: Connect to episodic and semantic memory systems
# Beliefs should be formed based on episodic experiences and should
# contribute to the formation of semantic knowledge
