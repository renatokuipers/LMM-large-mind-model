# Belief module 

# TODO: Implement belief module factory function to return an integrated BeliefSystem
# This module should be responsible for the formation, evaluation, updating, and 
# resolution of contradictions in the mind's belief system.

# TODO: Create BeliefSystem class that integrates all the belief sub-components:
# - belief_formation: responsible for forming new beliefs based on evidence and experiences
# - evidence_evaluation: evaluates the strength and reliability of evidence
# - belief_updating: modifies existing beliefs based on new evidence
# - contradiction_resolution: handles conflicting beliefs by resolving contradictions

# TODO: Implement development tracking for the belief system
# The belief system should evolve from simple, rigid beliefs in early stages
# to more nuanced, flexible, and evidence-based beliefs in later stages

# TODO: Connect belief module to memory, perception, and language modules
# Beliefs should be informed by perceptual experiences, memory, and language comprehension

# TODO: Implement confidence scoring for beliefs
# Each belief should have an associated confidence score based on 
# supporting evidence and consistency with other beliefs
