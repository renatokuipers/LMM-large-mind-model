# TODO: Implement the ContradictionResolution class to handle inconsistencies in beliefs
# This component should resolve contradictions through:
# - Detection of logical inconsistencies between beliefs
# - Prioritization of beliefs based on confidence and importance
# - Modification or abandonment of less supported beliefs
# - Integration of seemingly contradictory beliefs into a more nuanced belief system

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in contradiction resolution:
# - Simple elimination of one belief in early stages
# - Basic reconciliation attempts in middle stages
# - Complex integration of apparently contradictory information in later stages
# - Tolerance for appropriate ambiguity and uncertainty in advanced stages

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Contradiction detection: Identify logically incompatible beliefs
# - Belief prioritization: Determine which beliefs should be preserved
# - Belief modification: Adjust beliefs to resolve contradictions
# - Uncertainty accommodation: Increase uncertainty rather than force resolution

# TODO: Implement different resolution strategies:
# - Elimination: Remove the less supported belief
# - Compartmentalization: Maintain both beliefs in different contexts
# - Integration: Form a more complex belief that reconciles the contradiction
# - Suspension: Maintain uncertainty until more evidence is available

# TODO: Connect to the executive function module for cognitive control
# Resolution of significant contradictions may require executive function
# resources and conscious processing
