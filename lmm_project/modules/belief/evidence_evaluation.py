# TODO: Implement the EvidenceEvaluation class to assess the quality and reliability of evidence
# This component should evaluate evidence based on:
# - Source reliability
# - Consistency with existing knowledge
# - Internal coherence
# - Sample size and representativeness (for statistical evidence)
# - Personal experience vs. secondhand information

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in evidence evaluation:
# - Simple acceptance of evidence in early stages
# - Basic source checking in childhood
# - Sophisticated evaluation methods in later stages
# - Critical thinking capabilities in adult stage

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Evidence weighting: Assign weights to different evidence types
# - Probabilistic reasoning: Handle uncertain evidence
# - Evidential integration: Combine multiple pieces of evidence

# TODO: Implement bias detection and mitigation
# - Confirmation bias: Tendency to favor evidence supporting existing beliefs
# - Recency bias: Overweighting recent evidence
# - Authority bias: Overreliance on authoritative sources

# TODO: Connect to memory and episodic systems
# Evidence should be evaluated in the context of past experiences
# and previously encountered information
