# TODO: Implement the GrammarAcquisition class to learn and apply grammatical rules
# This component should be able to:
# - Identify grammatical patterns from language input
# - Extract and formalize grammatical rules
# - Apply learned rules in language comprehension and production
# - Handle syntactic processing and sentence structure

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in grammar acquisition:
# - Simple two-word combinations in early stages
# - Basic sentence structures in early childhood
# - Complex grammar and exceptions in later childhood
# - Advanced syntax and pragmatics in adolescence/adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Pattern detection: Identify recurring grammatical structures
# - Rule extraction: Formalize explicit and implicit rules
# - Syntactic parsing: Analyze sentence structure
# - Grammatical error detection: Identify violations of learned rules

# TODO: Implement different grammatical concepts:
# - Word order rules (syntax)
# - Morphological rules (word formation)
# - Agreement rules (subject-verb, etc.)
# - Dependency relationships between sentence elements

# TODO: Connect to word learning and semantic processing
# Grammar acquisition should work with lexical knowledge
# and contribute to meaning extraction
