# TODO: Implement the PhonemeRecognition class to identify basic speech sounds
# This component should be able to:
# - Recognize phonemes in speech input
# - Differentiate between similar phonemes
# - Adapt to different speakers and accents
# - Develop phonological awareness

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in phoneme recognition:
# - Basic categorical perception in early stages
# - Growing phoneme differentiation in early childhood
# - Phonological rule understanding in later childhood
# - Automaticity in phoneme processing in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Acoustic analysis: Extract relevant sound features
# - Phoneme categorization: Classify sounds as specific phonemes
# - Speaker normalization: Adjust for speaker differences
# - Phonological rule learning: Understand phoneme patterns

# TODO: Implement phonological awareness capabilities:
# - Phoneme identification: Recognize distinct sound units
# - Phoneme manipulation: Add/remove/change sounds
# - Syllable awareness: Recognize syllable boundaries
# - Pattern recognition: Identify rhymes and alliteration

# TODO: Connect to perception and word learning systems
# Phoneme recognition should draw on auditory perception
# and feed into word learning processes
