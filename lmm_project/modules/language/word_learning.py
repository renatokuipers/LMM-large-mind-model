# TODO: Implement the WordLearning class to acquire and manage vocabulary
# This component should be able to:
# - Learn new words from context and direct instruction
# - Connect words to meanings and concepts
# - Build and maintain a lexicon of known words
# - Track word frequency and familiarity

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in word learning:
# - Simple sound-object associations in early stages
# - Vocabulary explosion in early childhood
# - Growing semantic networks in later childhood
# - Abstract and specialized vocabulary in adolescence/adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Fast mapping: Form initial word-concept connections
# - Semantic enrichment: Develop deeper word meanings over time
# - Word retrieval: Access words efficiently from memory
# - Lexical organization: Structure vocabulary by semantic relationships

# TODO: Implement different word types and learning patterns:
# - Concrete nouns: Objects, people, places
# - Action verbs: Physical and mental actions
# - Descriptive words: Adjectives and adverbs
# - Relational words: Prepositions, conjunctions, etc.

# TODO: Connect to memory and perception systems
# Word learning should be tied to perceptual experiences
# and should store word knowledge in semantic memory
