# Language module

# TODO: Implement the language module factory function to return an integrated LanguageSystem
# This module should be responsible for language comprehension, production,
# acquisition, and semantic processing.

# TODO: Create LanguageSystem class that integrates all language sub-components:
# - phoneme_recognition: identifies basic speech sounds
# - word_learning: acquires and manages vocabulary
# - grammar_acquisition: learns and applies grammatical rules
# - semantic_processing: extracts meaning from language
# - expression_generator: produces language output

# TODO: Implement development tracking for language
# Language should develop from basic sounds and simple words in early stages
# to complex grammar and sophisticated semantics in later stages

# TODO: Connect language module to memory, perception, and social modules
# Language should be informed by perceptual experiences, draw from
# memory, and be influenced by social interactions

# TODO: Implement grounded language understanding
# Ensure language connects to actual experiences and perceptions
# rather than just mapping symbols to other symbols
