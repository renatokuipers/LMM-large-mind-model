# TODO: Implement the SemanticProcessing class to extract meaning from language
# This component should be able to:
# - Understand the meaning of words in context
# - Extract relationships between concepts in language
# - Interpret literal and non-literal language
# - Build semantic representations of sentences and discourse

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in semantic processing:
# - Simple direct meanings in early stages
# - Growing comprehension of relationships in childhood
# - Basic figurative language in later childhood
# - Complex abstractions and nuance in adolescence/adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Semantic composition: Combine word meanings into phrase meanings
# - Contextual interpretation: Adjust meanings based on context
# - Reference resolution: Determine what pronouns and references point to
# - Implication extraction: Infer unstated meanings and entailments

# TODO: Implement different semantic phenomena:
# - Polysemy: Multiple related meanings of words
# - Metaphor and simile: Figurative comparisons
# - Pragmatics: Social and contextual aspects of meaning
# - Entailment: Logical relationships between statements

# TODO: Connect to conceptual knowledge and memory
# Semantic processing should leverage conceptual knowledge
# and store extracted meanings in memory
