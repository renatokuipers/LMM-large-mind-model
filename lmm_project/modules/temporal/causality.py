# TODO: Implement the Causality class to understand cause-effect relationships
# This component should be able to:
# - Detect correlations between events across time
# - Infer causal relationships from correlations and interventions
# - Represent causal models of how events affect one another
# - Make predictions and counterfactual inferences using causal models

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in causal understanding:
# - Simple temporal associations in early stages
# - Basic cause-effect connections in childhood
# - Multiple causality understanding in adolescence
# - Complex causal networks and counterfactual reasoning in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Correlation detection: Identify events that co-occur
# - Intervention analysis: Learn from actions and their effects
# - Causal model building: Create structured representations of causes
# - Counterfactual simulation: Imagine alternative causal scenarios

# TODO: Implement different causal reasoning approaches:
# - Associative learning: Pattern-based causal inference
# - Bayesian reasoning: Probabilistic causal models
# - Structural modeling: Graph-based causal representations
# - Mechanism-based reasoning: Understanding causal principles

# TODO: Connect to learning and prediction modules
# Causal understanding should guide learning processes
# and inform predictive models
