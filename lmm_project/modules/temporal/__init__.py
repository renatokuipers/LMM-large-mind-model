# Temporal module 

# TODO: Implement the temporal module factory function to return an integrated TemporalSystem
# This module should be responsible for sequence learning, prediction,
# causality understanding, and time perception.

# TODO: Create TemporalSystem class that integrates all temporal sub-components:
# - sequence_learning: learns patterns over time
# - prediction: anticipates future states
# - causality: understands cause-effect relationships
# - time_perception: tracks and estimates time intervals

# TODO: Implement development tracking for temporal cognition
# Temporal capabilities should develop from simple sequence recognition in early stages
# to sophisticated prediction and causal understanding in later stages

# TODO: Connect temporal module to memory, learning, and consciousness modules
# Temporal cognition should utilize episodic memories, inform
# learning processes, and contribute to conscious awareness

# TODO: Implement prospection capabilities
# Include mental time travel to imagine future scenarios,
# plan sequences of actions, and anticipate outcomes
