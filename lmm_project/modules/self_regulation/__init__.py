# Self-regulation module

# TODO: Implement the self-regulation module factory function to return an integrated SelfRegulationSystem
# This module should be responsible for emotional regulation, impulse control,
# self-monitoring, and adaptive response adjustment.

# TODO: Create SelfRegulationSystem class that integrates all self-regulation sub-components:
# - emotional_regulation: manages emotional responses
# - impulse_control: inhibits inappropriate impulses
# - self_monitoring: tracks internal states and behaviors
# - adaptive_adjustment: modifies responses based on feedback

# TODO: Implement development tracking for self-regulation
# Self-regulation capabilities should develop from minimal regulation in early stages
# to sophisticated, flexible self-control in later stages

# TODO: Connect self-regulation module to emotion, executive, and consciousness modules
# Self-regulation should modify emotional responses, employ executive
# control mechanisms, and draw on conscious awareness

# TODO: Implement metacognitive aspects of self-regulation
# Include monitoring of regulation processes, strategic selection
# of regulation approaches, and regulation failure detection
