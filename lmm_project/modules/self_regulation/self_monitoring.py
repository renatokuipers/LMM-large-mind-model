# TODO: Implement the SelfMonitoring class to track internal states and behaviors
# This component should be able to:
# - Monitor internal states (emotions, thoughts, goals)
# - Track behavioral responses and their outcomes
# - Detect discrepancies between goals and current states
# - Provide feedback for regulatory processes

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in self-monitoring:
# - Basic state awareness in early stages
# - Growing behavior tracking in childhood
# - Increased metacognitive monitoring in adolescence
# - Sophisticated self-awareness in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - State detection: Identify current internal conditions
# - Discrepancy detection: Notice gaps between goals and reality
# - Progress tracking: Monitor advancement toward goals
# - Error detection: Identify mistakes and suboptimal responses

# TODO: Implement different monitoring types:
# - Emotional monitoring: Track affective states
# - Cognitive monitoring: Observe thoughts and beliefs
# - Behavioral monitoring: Track actions and responses
# - Social monitoring: Observe interpersonal impacts

# TODO: Connect to consciousness and identity modules
# Self-monitoring should utilize conscious awareness
# and contribute to self-concept development
