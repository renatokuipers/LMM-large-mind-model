# TODO: Implement the Inhibition class to suppress inappropriate actions and thoughts
# This component should be able to:
# - Block prepotent but inappropriate responses
# - Filter out irrelevant or distracting information
# - Delay gratification for better long-term outcomes
# - Maintain focus despite competing demands

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in inhibition:
# - Minimal inhibitory control in early stages
# - Growing ability to delay responses in childhood
# - Improved resistance to distractions in adolescence
# - Sophisticated self-control in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Response inhibition: Stop inappropriate actions
# - Interference control: Resist distractions
# - Delayed gratification: Wait for better rewards
# - Thought suppression: Control unwanted thoughts

# TODO: Implement resource modeling for inhibition:
# - Limited inhibitory resources that can be depleted
# - Recovery of inhibitory capacity over time
# - Factors affecting inhibitory strength (motivation, stress)
# - Individual differences in inhibitory capacity

# TODO: Connect to attention and emotion systems
# Inhibition should interact with attention for filtering
# and with emotion for emotional regulation
