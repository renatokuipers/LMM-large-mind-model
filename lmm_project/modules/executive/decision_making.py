# TODO: Implement the DecisionMaking class to evaluate options and make choices
# This component should be able to:
# - Evaluate multiple options based on various criteria
# - Calculate expected outcomes and utilities
# - Manage risk and uncertainty in decisions
# - Balance short-term and long-term consequences

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in decision making:
# - Simple immediate-reward decisions in early stages
# - Growing consideration of multiple factors in childhood
# - Inclusion of long-term outcomes in adolescence
# - Complex trade-off analysis in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Option generation: Identify possible choices
# - Value assignment: Determine the worth of potential outcomes
# - Probability estimation: Assess likelihood of outcomes
# - Outcome integration: Combine multiple factors into decisions

# TODO: Implement different decision strategies:
# - Maximizing: Select the option with highest expected utility
# - Satisficing: Select first option meeting minimum criteria
# - Elimination by aspects: Sequentially remove options failing criteria
# - Recognition-primed: Use past experience to make rapid decisions

# TODO: Connect to emotion and memory systems
# Decision making should be influenced by emotional responses
# and informed by memories of past decisions and outcomes
