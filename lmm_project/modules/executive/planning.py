# TODO: Implement the Planning class to develop and execute plans for goal achievement
# This component should be able to:
# - Create sequences of actions to achieve goals
# - Anticipate obstacles and develop contingency plans
# - Monitor plan execution and adjust as needed
# - Coordinate with other cognitive modules during plan execution

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in planning abilities:
# - Simple one-step plans in early stages
# - Short sequential plans in childhood
# - Complex hierarchical planning in adolescence
# - Strategic, flexible planning in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Goal representation: Maintain clear goal states
# - Action sequencing: Order actions appropriately
# - Temporal projection: Anticipate future states
# - Error detection: Identify deviations from the plan

# TODO: Implement different planning approaches:
# - Forward planning: Plan from current state to goal
# - Backward planning: Plan from goal to current state
# - Hierarchical planning: Break complex goals into subgoals
# - Opportunistic planning: Flexibly adapt plans to changing conditions

# TODO: Connect to working memory and attention systems
# Planning requires working memory resources to maintain plans
# and attention to monitor execution
