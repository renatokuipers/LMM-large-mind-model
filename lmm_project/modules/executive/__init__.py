# Executive module 

# TODO: Implement the executive module factory function to return an integrated ExecutiveSystem
# This module should be responsible for planning, decision-making, inhibition,
# cognitive control, and working memory management.

# TODO: Create ExecutiveSystem class that integrates all executive sub-components:
# - planning: develops and executes plans to achieve goals
# - decision_making: evaluates options and makes choices
# - inhibition: suppresses inappropriate actions and thoughts
# - working_memory_control: manages contents of working memory

# TODO: Implement development tracking for executive function
# Executive capabilities should develop from minimal control in early stages
# to sophisticated planning and self-regulation in later stages

# TODO: Connect executive module to attention, consciousness, and motivation modules
# Executive function should direct attention resources, be influenced by
# conscious goals, and be driven by motivational priorities

# TODO: Implement resource management for executive functions
# The system should have limited executive resources that must be
# allocated efficiently across different control demands
