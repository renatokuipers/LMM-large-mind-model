# TODO: Implement the WorkingMemoryControl class to manage working memory contents
# This component should be able to:
# - Maintain information in an active state
# - Update working memory contents as needed
# - Protect contents from interference
# - Manipulate and transform held information

# TODO: Implement developmental progression in working memory control:
# - Very limited capacity and duration in early stages
# - Gradual increase in capacity during childhood
# - Improved manipulation abilities in adolescence
# - Strategic working memory management in adulthood

# TODO: Create mechanisms for:
# - Maintenance: Keep information active through rehearsal
# - Updating: Replace old information with new when appropriate
# - Binding: Associate multiple pieces of information together
# - Manipulation: Transform or reorganize held information

# TODO: Implement capacity limitations:
# - Limit on number of items that can be held simultaneously
# - Limit on complexity of items based on developmental level
# - Trade-offs between maintenance and manipulation
# - Interference effects between similar items

# TODO: Connect to attention and consciousness systems
# Working memory should be influenced by attentional focus
# and should feed information to conscious awareness
