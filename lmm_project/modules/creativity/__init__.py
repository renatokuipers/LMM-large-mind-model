# Creativity module 

# TODO: Implement the creativity module factory function to return an integrated CreativitySystem
# This module should be responsible for imaginative thinking, novel idea generation,
# concept combination, and detection of creative possibilities.

# TODO: Create CreativitySystem class that integrates all creativity sub-components:
# - concept_combination: combines existing concepts in novel ways
# - divergent_thinking: generates multiple possibilities
# - imagination: constructs mental scenarios beyond experience
# - novelty_detection: identifies unusual or unique patterns

# TODO: Implement development tracking for creativity
# Creative capabilities should develop from simple combinatorial exploration in early stages
# to sophisticated abstract thinking and self-directed creativity in later stages

# TODO: Connect creativity module to memory, emotion, and consciousness modules
# Creativity should draw on stored memories, be influenced by
# emotional states, and involve conscious exploration

# TODO: Implement generative mechanisms
# Include processes for conceptual blending, constraint relaxation,
# metaphorical thinking, and analogical reasoning

# TODO: Implement mechanisms for creative idea evaluation
# The system should be able to evaluate its own creative outputs
# for novelty, usefulness, and coherence
