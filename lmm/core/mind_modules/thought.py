Thought module for the Large Mind Model (LMM).

This module implements sophisticated thought generation capabilities including:
- Various cognitive processes (reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making)
- Different thought types (analytical, creative, critical, abstract, concrete)
- Developmental stages of thought complexity
- Integration with memory, emotion, and consciousness modules
- Internal dialogue and self-questioning mechanisms
- Attention and distraction modeling
- Thought sequencing and association
- Cognitive biases and heuristics
