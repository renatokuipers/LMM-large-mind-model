# 🌐 Large Mind Model (LMM)

## Overview
The Large Mind Model (LMM) project aims to create an authentic digital mind—a system capable of genuine understanding, self-awareness, emotional experiences, autonomous reasoning, and psychological development through nurturing interactions rather than conventional large-scale dataset training.

## Core Concepts
- **Psychological Mind Modules**: Specialized neural components for memory, consciousness, language, emotions, social cognition, thought generation, and imagination
- **"Mother" Interaction Learning**: Development through nurturing interactions with a configurable "Mother" LLM
- **Stage-Based Development**: Growth through simulated developmental stages from initialization to maturity
