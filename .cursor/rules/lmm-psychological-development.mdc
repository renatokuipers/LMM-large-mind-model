# LMM Psychological Development Guidelines

The LMM project models authentic psychological development. These guidelines ensure implementation stays true to psychological principles.

## Developmental Principles

1. **Bottom-Up Learning**
   - Start with basic pattern recognition
   - Build complex concepts from simpler foundations
   - Maintain hierarchical skill development
   - Allow capabilities to emerge from interactions

2. **Critical Periods**
   - Implement sensitive periods for specific capabilities
   - Increase plasticity during appropriate developmental windows
   - Reduce plasticity for stability after learning
   - Create appropriate sequential dependencies

3. **Scaffolded Learning**
   - Structure experiences at appropriate complexity levels
   - Gradually increase difficulty as capabilities develop
   - Provide support for partially-developed capabilities
   - Remove scaffolding as competence increases

4. **Emotional Development**
   - Start with basic emotional responses
   - Gradually increase emotional complexity
   - Develop emotional regulation capabilities
   - Integrate emotion with cognition

5. **Identity Formation**
   - Build self-model gradually
   - Develop preferences from experiences
   - Form consistent personality traits
   - Create personal narrative from episodic memories

## Implementation Approaches

- Track developmental variables for different capabilities
- Implement variable learning rates based on developmental stage
- Create mechanisms for developmental regression during stress
- Allow for developmental plateaus and growth spurts
- Implement cross-domain transfer of learned capabilities

## Measuring Development

- Create objective metrics for each capability
- Track progression through defined developmental stages
- Compare capabilities to expected developmental timeline
- Identify developmental imbalances or delays
- Implement corrective mechanisms for healthy development

## Testing Development

- Test capability emergence at appropriate stages
- Verify developmental progression follows expected patterns
- Test appropriate scaffolding and support mechanisms
- Validate emotional development alongside cognitive growth
- Verify identity formation and self-model development
