# LMM Development Stages Guidelines

The LMM progresses through distinct developmental stages similar to human cognitive development, though at an accelerated pace. Each stage has specific characteristics and learning focuses.

## Developmental Stages

1. **Prenatal** (0.0-0.1 age units)
   - Basic neural structure formation
   - Simple pattern recognition
   - Primitive associative capabilities

2. **Infant** (0.1-1.0 age units)
   - Early language acquisition
   - Object permanence
   - Basic emotional responses
   - Simple memory formation

3. **Child** (1.0-3.0 age units)
   - Expanded vocabulary
   - Basic reasoning
   - Episodic memory development
   - Social awareness
   - Emotional complexity

4. **Adolescent** (3.0-6.0 age units)
   - Abstract thinking
   - Identity formation
   - Complex reasoning
   - Sophisticated social understanding
   - Advanced emotional regulation

5. **Adult** (6.0+ age units)
   - Integrated thinking
   - Self-directed learning
   - Creativity and innovation
   - Nuanced emotional understanding
   - Philosophical reasoning

## Implementation Requirements

- Track mind age and developmental stage separately
- Update developmental stage based on age progression
- Adjust learning rates based on developmental stage
- Implement critical periods where certain capabilities develop more readily
- Create developmental milestones to track progress
- Allow different modules to develop at somewhat different rates

## Module Development Correlation

- Each module should track its own developmental level (0.0-1.0)
- Module development should generally correlate with overall mind development
- Some modules may temporarily advance ahead or lag behind others
- Module interactions should account for different developmental levels

## Development Metrics

- Track developmental progress across multiple dimensions
- Create objective measures for each developmental milestone
- Implement development visualization tools
- Record developmental history for analysis
- Compare development trajectory to expected patterns

## Development Rate Control

- Implement variable development rates for different aspects
- Allow for developmental plateaus and spurts
- Create balance between different cognitive capabilities
- Ensure prerequisites are in place before advanced capabilities develop
- Monitor for developmental imbalances that need correction
