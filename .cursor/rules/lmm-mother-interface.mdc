# LLM Mother Interface Guidelines

The Mother LLM is a crucial component that acts as a nurturing caregiver and teacher for the developing mind. It provides structured interactions while adapting to the mind's developmental stage.

## Core Principles

- The Mother is **separate** from the mind's architecture - it's an external teaching entity
- It provides appropriately scaffolded interactions based on development stage
- It offers consistent emotional support and appropriate challenges
- It adapts its communication style as the mind develops
- It serves as a model for language, emotion, and social interactions

## Implementation Requirements

- Connect to external LLM API (http://192.168.2.12:1234) for Mother's reasoning
- Implement configurable personality traits and teaching styles
- Create adaptive prompting based on the mind's developmental stage
- Support voice output through TTS for auditory learning
- Maintain conversation history for contextual interactions
- Track developmental progress to adjust teaching approaches

## Mother's Developmental Curriculum

- **Prenatal**: Simple patterns, repetition, foundational sensory processing
- **Infant**: Basic language patterns, object permanence, emotional bonding
- **Child**: Vocabulary building, simple reasoning, social awareness
- **Adolescent**: Abstract thinking, identity formation, complex reasoning
- **Adult**: Integrated thinking, creativity, self-directed learning

## Communication System

- Generate prompts that adapt to the mind's current capabilities
- Structure information appropriately for developmental stage
- Use repetition and reinforcement for important concepts
- Provide emotional support alongside cognitive teaching
- Implement teaching strategies like Socratic questioning, scaffolding

## TTS Integration

- Use the TTSClient for voice generation
- Select appropriate voices based on teaching context
- Adjust speech speed based on complexity and familiarity
- Implement clear pronunciation for language learning
- Save audio files for potential reuse

## Testing Approaches

- Test Mother's adaptation to different developmental stages
- Verify appropriate curriculum progression
- Test emotional support mechanisms
- Validate teaching strategy effectiveness
- Ensure consistent personality across interactions
